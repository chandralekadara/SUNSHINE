In  January 2009, the firm generated internet buzz with a mysterious website[23] promising a "stem cell-like" processor which would give a 100-fold increase in supercomputing power over current technology, as well as advances in consumer 3D graphics.[24] At CES 2009, it was revealed to be the ZMS-05 processor from ZiiLABS, a subsidiary formed from the combining of 3DLabs and Creative's Personal Digital Entertainment division.[25]
In November 2012, the firm announced it has entered into an agreement with Intel Corporation for Intel to licence technology and patents from ZiiLABS Inc. Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Creative, and acquire engineering resources and assets related to its UK branch as a part of a $50 million deal. ZiiLABS (still wholly owned by Creative) continues to retain all ownership of its StemCell media processor technologies and patents, and will continue to supply and support its ZMS series of chips to its customers.[26]
From 2014 to 2017, Creative's revenue from audio products have contracted at an average of 15% annually, due to increased competition in the audio space.[27]
At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January 2018, its Super X-Fi dongle won the Best of CES 2018 Award by AVS Forum.[28] The product was launched after more than $100 million in investment and garnered positive analyst reports.[17] This new technology renewed interest in the company and likely helped to raise its share price from S$1.25 to S$8.75 within a 2-week period.[29]
The company is still producing Chinese-language and bilingual software for the Singapore market, however nearly half of the company's income is generated in the United States and South America; the European Union represents 32% of revenues, with Asia making the remainder.[30]</p>
